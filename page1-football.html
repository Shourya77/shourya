                    <p class="lead">I will be starting my internship at Northwestern Football Analytics over Winter Break and would be working on a project that analyzes video footage of the game. We would be analyzing the footage based on several parameters to determine statistics like what distance does a player run
                        in a game, what is their average pace during the game etc. This would help them improve the game by understand important statistcs to come up with better strategies and prepare better plays. Really excited to work on this project!
